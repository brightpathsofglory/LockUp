#GPG Recipient
#Specify the email address of the recipient / owner of the backup files.
#The GPG Public Key must be installed in your public keychain.
#RECIPIENT=user@myemail.com

#Local backup staging directory
#WARNING: **DONOT USE A DIRECTORY WHICH EXISTS.**
#WARNING: **DONOT MANUALLY SAVE INFORMATION TO THIS DIRECTORY.**
#Information to be backed up will be copied here before being encrypted.
#This location must have enough space e.g. minimum ~ size of backup information
#and be readable and writeable to the user.
LOCAL_BACKUP_DIRECTORY=/var/tmp/lockup

#Remote File ID is the identification string of the directory in your
#Google Drive where encrypted backups will be uploaded. To find this value
#use the gdrive tool. See https://gdrive.hask.no for complete information
#or run gdrive mkdir {dir} to create a directory and note the id.
#REMOTE_FILEID=

#Backup Directories list all the target directories (and subdirectories)
#to backup. Specif each directory in-between the parenthesis. The directory
#must be between two double quotes. Each directory seperated with a space
#BACKUP_DIRECTORIES=("/home/user/Pictures" "/home/user/Documents" "/home/user/Work Documents")

#File can be encrypted in binary format or ASCII format. Both are equally secure.
#Both have advantages and disadvantages, consult the gpg manual for further information
#An entry must exist for each directory set in BACKUP_DIRECTORIES.

#Valid options are bin or ascii
#ENCRYPTION_FORMATS=("ascii" "ascii" "bin")

#Command paths
#Specify the full path of the following tools.
#gdrive, find, gpg and grep. Some of these tools will likely need to
#be installed on your system. Others will be present already.
#To find the path use the which command e.g. which grep
GDRIVE_PATH=/usr/bin/gdrive
FIND_PATH=/usr/bin/find
GPG_PATH=/usr/local/bin/gpg
GREP_PATH=/usr/bin/grep

#Lock file
#This directive should specify the full path of a PID file. It should be a globally
#unique file on each system if LOCAL_BACKUP_DIRECTORY is shared between multiple
#users. If LOCAL_BACKUP_DIRECTORY is unique then LOCK_FILE can also be unique. 
#The path should be readable and writeable by the user.
LOCK_FILE=/tmp/lockup-ba63829.pid
